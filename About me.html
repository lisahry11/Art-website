  <h2>About me!</h2>
  <p>Photography is my passion!</p>
  <p>
    Art has always inspired me from a very young age. I have enjoyed drawing and
    painting, but when I got to high school and college I discovered my interest
    in photography. It was like opening a new door of my journey. I was able to
    tell a story through a photo whether it was the lighting, angle or even the
    placement of the item in the photo. I have experimented with different
    subject types but my go to are black and white photos of objects. The
    dramatic effect of the black and white image brings the object to life.

    This form of art is not only beautiful but also helped me unlock a different
    side of me that I did not know existed. I am excited to share my art with
    the world!
